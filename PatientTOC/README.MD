# PatientTOC : Verify transfer of care received is our patient

The clinic receives Transfer of Care reports when another medical institution sees a patient.
For some reason, our clinic has been receiving a large number of TOC reports that are *NOT* our patients.

This project intends to automate the process of checking for patients, and identifying which patients are not in our care.
