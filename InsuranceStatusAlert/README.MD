# InsuranceStatusAlert
 1) Set alert on accounts with no insurance, so staff can offer to enroll them through our Sharing Healthcare Options Program (SHOP)
    - If the patient has declined insurance enrollment (or tried and is ineligible) let their profile be marked such and do not 
      continue to set the alert for their account.

 2) Set alert on accounts with a form of Medicaid insurance, so front office staff can effectively schedule these patients with our Medicaid providers

 3) Set alert on accounts with a form of Medicare insurance, so front office staff can effectively schedule these patients with our Medicare providers

Maintain alerts:
 - For each of the above (3) alerts, check their insurance status and deactivate/reactivate accordingly

This script will run as a scheduled job to maintain an updated status on our patients.
