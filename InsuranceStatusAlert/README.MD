# InsuranceStatusAlert
Set alert on accounts with no insurance, so staff can offer to enroll them through our Sharing Healthcare Options Program (SHOP)
This script will run as a scheduled job to maintain an updated status on our patients.

If the patient has declined insurance enrollment (or tried and is ineligible) let their profile be marked such and do not continue to set the alert for their account.
