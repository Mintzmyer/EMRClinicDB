#New Head Physician changeover
Our clinic has a new Head Physician who is responsible for all patients who use our clinic as their medical home. (IE Non-acute visits)

As such, she must be the Primary Care Physician for all of our patients whose previous PCP was the former Head Physician

This project contains some of the steps and sub-problems involved in that update
